- Hi, I’m Iiro Koskinen
- I'm studying ICT at TUNI (Started in 2020)
- I know Python, C++ and Java
- Here I have some of the bigger projects I have done with Python and C++ in school so far and also some smaller Java projects as I haven't done any bigger ones yet.
- In the future I also plan to add personal projects here
